# COVID ADAPT GUI

## Getting Started

Welcome to the COVID ADAPT GUI. This is the GUI for Kriztian Magori's COVID_ADAPT simulation which can be found [here](https://github.com/kmagori/COVID-ADAPT)

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains these folders:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

## Dependency Management

The `EXAMPLE` view allows you to manage your dependencies. We don't use this at all. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-pack/blob/master/release-notes/v0.9.0.md#work-with-jar-files-directly).


## Format Conventions

### Naming Conventions

#### Files

File names should be named after the classes that they contain. They should also be named in two parts. The first part of the name should describe what the code is, The second part should describe what it does.
ie: `Window_Start.py` is named after its class, "Window_Start()". The word "window" describes that it is one of the main windows that can be brought up by the program. The word "start" describes it's purpous as the intial window of the program.

#### Functions and variables

Name functions and variables using camel case and no spaces.
ie: functionsAndVariables()
